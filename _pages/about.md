Hi, and welcome to my home on the Internet!

My name is Aziz, I do coding and other stuff. Additionally, I organize <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nychtml5/" target="_blank">the NYCHTML5 Meetup</a>.

I started coding at a fairly young age and in the past couple of years I've been exploring and enjoying the use of JavaScript for all kinds of purposes.

When I'm not building something, I'm probably reading, learning foreign languages, working out, playing guitar, tennis, and all sorts of other things. I always seek new hobbies to try out, so feel free to [ping me](/contact) if you have any cool suggestions.
